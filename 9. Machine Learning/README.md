# Machine Learning with Python

## üìÑ Summary 
This course provides an overview of the purpose of Machine Learning, and where it applies to the real world. It then covers topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and various useful Machine Learning algorithms. 

To explore the methods of machine learning, and the algorithms involved, many example projects are embarked upon and explored, including cancer detection, predicting economic trends, predicting customer churn, and recommendation engines.

The [final project](https://github.com/Bhuribhat/IBM-Data-Science/tree/main/9.%20Machine%20Learning/Week%205%20-%20Final%20Project) within this course is the building of a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off. It is a classification problem, and KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, and Logistic Regression are all used to determine the best algorithm to use.
